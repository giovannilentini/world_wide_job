# Project Languages and Technology for the Web: World Wide Job

## Team Members:
- **Daniele De Pascali**
- **Giovanni Lentini**

## Project Description:
We have created this website with the aim of providing a space where users can publish and search for part-time job opportunities. To achieve this, we utilized a combination of **HTML-5**, **CSS**, **PHP**, and **AJAX**.

## File Contents:
Our project is intuitively organized, with 9 pages, each located in a dedicated folder. Each folder contains the necessary JavaScript scripts (with AJAX calls), PHP files, and CSS styles. Additionally, you will find the folders: `database`, `images`, and `profileimages`.

- The `database` folder contains all the scripts to connect to our MySQL database, including the `database.php` file that manages the connection. Additionally, there are the `login.php` and `registration.php` files which utilize the database connection to add or select users to create a new session. Finally, the `logout.php` file ends the session.
- Images used for the website's graphics are stored in the `images` folder.
- Lastly, user profile images are archived in the `profileimages` folder.
