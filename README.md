Project Description: With this project, we aimed to create a website where it is possible to post and search for part-time job offers. For development, we used HTML-5, CSS, PHP, and AJAX.

File Description: The site contains 9 pages, each located in a folder which also includes JavaScript scripts (with AJAX calls), PHP scripts, and CSS styles. Besides these folders, there are the database, images, and profileimages folders.
In the database folder, we find all the scripts necessary to connect to the database. Specifically, there is the “database.php” file that manages the connection to the MySQL database. Additionally, there are the “login.php” and “registration.php” files that use the database connection to add or select users to create a new session. Finally, the “logout.php” file ends the session.
The images folder stores all the images used for the site's graphics.
The profileimages folder stores the profile pictures of all users.
